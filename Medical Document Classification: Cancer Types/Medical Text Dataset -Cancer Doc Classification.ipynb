By counting these occurrences, we identified that these are broken ligatures (e.g., the letters \"fi\" becoming \"ï¬\") likely caused by PDF-to-text extraction errors. \n",

We also perform a \"final scrub\" to remove tokenizer glitches and chemical instrument names that were acting as noise. \n",
    "* The post-cleaning verification confirms that the top features for all classes are now exclusively biological terms—such as \"EGFR mutation\" for lung cancer and \"signaling pathway\" for thyroid cancer—ensuring that our subsequent machine learning models will learn from actual pathology rather than formatting errors."

    "* The final evaluation conclusively proved that simpler, feature-engineered models like Random Forest are superior in this low-resource environment, offering high accuracy and interpretability without the computational cost or data requirements of deep neural networks.\n",
    "* The project successfully established a production-ready baseline model achieving approximately 77% accuracy, validating that rigorous data hygiene and appropriate model selection are more critical than architectural complexity in medical NLP tasks."
